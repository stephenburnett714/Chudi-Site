          I am proficient in processing and using different kinds of data to
          create audiovisual installations and multimedia art pieces. Utilizing
          Blender, Touchdesigner, Houdini, and Computer Science skills, I create
          media for local bands, businesses, and my own personal narrative
          projects.

          This work ranges from realtime renders and performances to music
          videos, virtual productions, and digital installations.

          Touchdesigner has allowed me to create realtime animations driven by
          data and music. Manipulating and processing data has allowed me to
          push the cerebral work I make in my renders into something modular and
          experential. Touchdesigner's advanced data processing tools has
          allowed me to create data visualizations, implement GLSL into my art,
          and allow them to become live performances.

          My most recent projects involve processing data and sensory
          information within the software to design and study interactive
          displays and experiences.

        <div>
          I use Houdini's powerful tools to procedurally model and create unique
          animations. Houdini enables me to composite more complex simulations
          and animation within my projects, as well as interface with data more
          easily during the rendering process. Houdini also serves as my VFX and
          simulation software, compositing or transfering data from simulations
          into different programs like Blender or Touchdesigner to create more
          complex art that showcases a knowledge of data processing and
          compositing work.
