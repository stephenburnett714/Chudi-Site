          Passionate about multimedia art, creating experential media- I spend
          my free time creating audiovisual installations, working on games, and
          the many art projects around the site. I focus on the intersection of
          technology, art, and reality, leveraging my Computer Science skills to
          create more complex productions that feature a pipeline of multiple
          technologies. Leveraging Touchdesigner, Blender and Houdini, I can
          design, perform, and fufill all aspects of digital production and
          design.
